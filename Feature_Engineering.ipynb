        "\n",
        "1. **What is a parameter?**\n",
        "   \n",
        "   A parameter is a variable within a function or model that can be adjusted or learned. In machine learning, parameters (such as weights and biases) are adjusted during training so that the model can best map inputs to outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **What is correlation? What does negative correlation mean?**\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the degree to which two variables are linearly related. It is typically expressed as a value between -1 and 1. A correlation of 1 means perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
        "   Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease. It indicates an inverse relationship between the two variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?**\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms that learn from and make predictions on data without being explicitly programmed. The main components include:\n",
        "   - **Data:** The raw information used to train and evaluate models.\n",
        "   - **Features:** The input variables or attributes derived from the data.\n",
        "   - **Model:** The mathematical or computational structure that maps inputs to outputs.\n",
        "   - **Loss Function:** A metric that measures the error of the model’s predictions.\n",
        "   - **Optimizer:** An algorithm that adjusts the model parameters to minimize the loss.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. **How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?**\n",
        "   \n",
        "   The loss value quantifies the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs. A lower loss value indicates that the model’s predictions are closer to the actual values, which generally means a better-performing model. It is used during training to guide the optimization of parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **What are continuous and categorical variables?**\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **Continuous Variables:** Variables that can take any numeric value within a range, such as temperature or height.\n",
        "   - **Categorical Variables:** Variables that represent distinct categories or groups, such as color or type of product.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?**\n",
        "   \n",

        "   \n",
        "   - **Training:** The process of teaching a model using a subset of the data to learn the underlying relationships.\n",
        "   - **Testing:** Evaluating the model on a separate subset of the data that it has not seen during training to assess its performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **What is `sklearn.preprocessing`?**\n",
        "   \n",
        "   `sklearn.preprocessing` is a module in scikit-learn that provides functions and classes for data preprocessing, such as scaling, normalization, and encoding categorical variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **What is a Test set?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    A test set is a subset of the dataset that is held out during model training and used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.\n",

        "    A typical approach involves:\n",
        "    - Defining the problem\n",
        "    - Collecting and exploring the data (EDA)\n",
        "    - Preprocessing and feature engineering\n",

        "    - Tuning hyperparameters\n",
        "    - Deployment\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) helps understand the data structure, detect outliers, uncover patterns, and inform decisions on data cleaning and feature engineering, all of which are crucial for building effective models.\n",

        "\n",
        "15. **What is causation? Explain the difference between correlation and causation with an example.**\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **Causation** implies that one event is the direct result of another. In contrast, **correlation** indicates a relationship between two variables without proving that one causes the other. For example, ice cream sales and drowning incidents may be correlated (both rise in summer), but ice cream sales do not cause drowning incidents; rather, a lurking variable (summer heat) affects both.\n",

        "16. **What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.**\n",
        "    \n",

        "    \n",

        "22. **How do we perform scaling in Python?**\n",
        "    \n",
